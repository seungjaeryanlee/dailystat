# DailyStat

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seungjaeryanlee/dailystat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seungjaeryanlee/dailystat)

## Running

The `index.py` file takes one argument: the name of the input text file. Running

```
./index.py example.txt
```

would parse the `example.txt` file and calculate the productivity. If it cannot classify certain activities, the user will be prompted to classify it manually.
